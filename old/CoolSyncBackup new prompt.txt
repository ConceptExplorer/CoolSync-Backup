CoolSync Backup script to backup files and folders being aware if the temperature of the drives are low enough to operate safely. Script starts a sync when the user clicks start, monitors temps and syncs only when the drive is within safe temperature ranges specified by the user. The program stops when one of the states is met, sync is complete, user clicks stop. In the case the temperature gets too high the backup pauses and waits for the drive to reach the low temp specified by the user.
